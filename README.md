<h2><a name="credits">Credits</a></h2><br>
**Ferox** - API and Console, without such contributions, projects like this would never have been possible. <br/>
**PokeMobTeam Dev & staff** - Their relentless work day after day on adding new features, ironing out bugs and maintaining the ever growing community.<br>
**Everyone else who submitted Pull Requests** - Big or small, the work from unmentioned contributors are what makes this project community-oriented. <br>
**Everyone who contributed to NecroBot** before we split off and became our own entitity, including ourselves since aparently we also need to credit ourselves? Commit history has been lost to history since NecroBot shutdown.
